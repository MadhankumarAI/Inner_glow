# Skin Condition Detection AI

## CNN model developed by "Team Technovators" 

## It has an accuracy of over 75% with an ability to classify skin dieses based on the images provided by the users and provide a detailed solution roadmap to cure the skin condition. 

## 🌟 Overview
This AI-powered project uses deep learning to classify skin conditions from medical images. Built with a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model learns from thousands of labeled skin images to predict diseases accurately.

## 📂 Dataset: HAM10000
We use the **HAM10000 dataset**, which contains over **10,000 skin images** across different categories, including:
- **Melanoma** (Skin cancer)
- **Nevus** (Moles)
- **Basal cell carcinoma** (BCC)
- **Actinic keratosis** (AK)
- **Benign keratosis** (BK)
- **Dermatofibroma** (DF)
- **Vascular lesions**

## 🔧 Preprocessing the Images
Before training the model, the images go through:
- **Resizing** – Standardizing image size for consistency 📏
- **Normalization** – Converting pixel values from **0–255** to **0–1** 🎨
- **Data Augmentation** – Flipping, rotating, and zooming to improve model robustness 🔄

## 🏗️ Model Architecture (CNN)
The model follows a **CNN-based approach**, which mimics how the human brain recognizes patterns.

### 🚀 Layers of the CNN:
- **Convolution Layers** – Detects edges, textures, and color variations 🖼️
- **Pooling Layers** – Reduces image size while keeping important features 📉
- **Dense Layers** – Processes information and predicts the final skin condition 🧠

## 🎯 Model Training
The model is trained using **supervised learning** with:
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam (to adjust learning rates efficiently) ⚡
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score 📊

### Example Learning Process:
👶 **Child learning to identify apples:** At first, they confuse apples with tomatoes 🍎🍅, but with feedback, they improve.
🧠 Similarly, our AI refines its predictions over time through **backpropagation**.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
To measure performance, we use:
- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness ✅
- **Confusion Matrix:** Tracks classification errors 📉
- **Precision & Recall:** Balances between false positives & false negatives ⚖️

## 🔍 Making Predictions
Once trained, the model can analyze new skin images and classify the condition.
💡 **Example:** Just like Google Lens identifies objects, this AI can detect skin diseases! 📸

## 🌐 Deployment
We can deploy this model via:
- **Web App (Flask / FastAPI)** 🌍
- **Mobile App (TensorFlow Lite)** 📱
- **Cloud API for Healthcare Integration** ☁️

## 💡 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with more diverse datasets 📈  
🔹 Real-time skin analysis via smartphone cameras 📷  
🔹 AI-powered dermatology assistant for doctors 🏥
